# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to determine how many employees are close to retirement, what depts/titles they hold and compare that to how many roles will need to be filled and how many mentors will be needed to train the next generation. 

## Results
The highest number of people going to retire are engineers, followed by senior managers. There are also almost 2,000 employees who coud participate in either filling those roles or mentoring those who could fill them. Many of the retirement-ready employees starting working at the company no later than the early 2000s, meaning most of them have many years experience at Pewlett-Hackard. In addition, a majority of those that are eligible to be mentors have also been at the company for at least ~15 years, meaning they would have plenty of experience with training a new wave of engineers and managers. 


## Summary
About 90, 398 roles will need to be filled soon. This means that there are likely not enough employees to mentor the next generation. Additional queries should be created to to sort out from the mentorship eligibilty who would be qualified to mentor those for Senior Engineer and Senior Manager positions specifically, as well as other roles as Technique Leaders or other Managers from different departments.
